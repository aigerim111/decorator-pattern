# decorator-pattern
I used decorator pattern on base of ingredients for bakery. Component is BakeryImplementation class. There are three concrete components - Croissant, Sandwich, Pancakes classes, as they are base-ingredients that can be decorated. And Decorator is BaseDecorator class. And there are several concrete decoraters such as Chicken, Nutella, Tomatoes, Tofu and so on.  
Decorator pattern was used beacuse of easy modification, and i don't need to create many classes of basic ingredients with different ingredients.
