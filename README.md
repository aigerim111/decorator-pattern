# decorator-pattern
I used decorator pattern on base of ingredients for bakery. Component is BakeryImplementation class. There are three concrete components - Croissant, Sandwich, Pancakes classes, as they are base-ingredients that can be decorated. And Decorator is BaseDecorator class. And there are several concrete decoraters such as Chicken, Nutella, Tomatoes, Tofu and so on.
